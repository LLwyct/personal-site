I am currently a graduate student in computer science. I will share my study and work experience here, and occasionally talk about my daily life and share my mood in life.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                    My postgraduate major is the formal verification of neural networks. And I have implemented a simple <a href=\"https://github.com/LLwyct/FFNN-Verify\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\" style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>neural network verification tool</a> on my github using an optimization algorithm based on MILP. I want to work in front-end development in the future, because I think front-end development is a very interesting thing. You can quickly see the pages you make, and you can add your aesthetics and show your thoughts to others.\n                </p>\n            </section>\n        </Layout>\n    )\n}\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
